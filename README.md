# Pytest Alembic Experiments

Experiments using pytest to validate Alembic database migrations.

## Overview

This experiment tests: 

- whether [`alembic`](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org) migrations can be tested under [`pytest`](https://pytest.org), 
  using [`pytest-alembic`](https://pytest-alembic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- CRUD operations for SQLAlchemy models

There are two versions of these experiments:

- [version 1](https://github.com/felnne/pytest-alembic-experiments/releases/tag/v0.1.0) uses a very simple, generic 
  schema (single table with auto-incrementing ID and text label fields)
- [version 2](https://github.com/felnne/pytest-alembic-experiments/releases/tag/v0.2.0) uses schemas from the BAS 
  Locations Register project (multiple tables, PostGIS extension, FK relationship, function & trigger, enumerations)

Use version 1 if you want to see how this technique works. Use version 2 if you want to see how it works with a more
complicated schema.

## Setup

Requirements:

* Git
* Python
* Poetry
* Postgres with PostGIS extension

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/felnne/pytest-alembic-experiments.git
$ poetry install
# this is not normally necessary, but for whatever reason Poetry won't recognise the local package and install it
$ echo ~/pytest-alembic-exp/src' > .venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/coke.pth
$ psql -d postgres -c 'CREATE DATABASE pytest_alembic;'
```

Check things work manually:

```
$ APP_DB_DSN=postgresql://$user@localhost/pytest_alembic poetry run alembic upgrade head
$ SQLALCHEMY_SILENCE_UBER_WARNING=1 APP_DB_DSN=postgresql://$user@localhost/pytest_alembic poetry run python -m coke
$ APP_DB_DSN=postgresql://$user@localhost/pytest_alembic poetry run alembic downgrade base
```

Reset DB:

```
$ psql -d postgres -c 'DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS pytest_alembic;' && psql -d postgres -c 'CREATE DATABASE pytest_alembic;'
```

Check DB DSN environment variable set correctly:

```
$ APP_DB_DSN=postgresql://$user@localhost/pytest_alembic poetry run python -m coke.config
```

## Usage

Locally:

```
$ APP_DB_DSN=postgresql://$user@localhost/pytest_alembic SQLALCHEMY_SILENCE_UBER_WARNING=1 poetry run pytest
```

CI:

- commits to this repository will trigger GitLab CI to run tests using a service container, see `.gitlab-ci.yml` (if 
  using GitLab)

## Notes

* once DSN removed from `alembic.ini`, all other config options are either static (package location) or defaults
* offline mode is where Alembic generates SQL statements to run standalone, rather than Alembic modifying the DB
* if DDL test fails, you can generate an automatic migration to see what's missing [1]
* in CI, Alembic fails because the official PostGIS image includes more than just the PostGIS extension (tiger etc.)
  * rather than create a new image etc. it was easiest to add `psql` in the app container and drop extra extensions
  * see https://github.com/postgis/docker-postgis/issues/187 for changing image to not add these extensions by default
* testing `alembic-utils` resources:
  * adding `alembic-utils` results in `pytest-alembic` detecting any replicable object in the DDL comparison test
  * in our case, this includes the Function and Trigger used for updating the `updated_at` column (which we'd want to
    track), but also includes objects are things like the PostGIS extension, it's indexes and views (which we don't)
  * I tried to replicate all of these objects into `models.py` using the `alembic-utils` classes, and then use 
    `register_entities([...])` referencing these objects
  * this worked in that I think in the `pytest-alembic` DDL test, it was trying to create these entities as part of the
    comparison, but was failing because the resources already existed (as they are created when enabling the PostGIS 
    extension)
  * to fix that, you would need to use `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` or `CREATE VIEW IF NOT EXISTS` etc. to fail gracefully
  * within the `alembic-util` classes, there is logic to do this, but I couldn't see how to trigger it
  * at the moment, testing these resources isn't a strict requirement, so I have instead excluded them from the 
    comparison using `alembic`'s 
    [exclude](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/autogenerate.html#controlling-what-to-be-autogenerated) logic
  * I think with some further experimentation and hacking this could probably be made to work so worth adding as a 
    backlog item
* `pytest-alembic` experimental tests:
  * reviewing the two experimental tests ('all models register on metadata' and 'downgrade leaves no trace')
  * both would likely fail due to the workarounds used to exclude replaceable objects
  * given these tests are experimental, I don't think this is a significant problem
* PostGIS spatial references table:
  * as a late edition, having excluded all replaceable entities as part of integrating `alembic-utils`, I configured
    `alembic` to exclude the PostGIS spatial references table as well, rather than needing this to be defined as an
    app model
  * this is compatible with the `pytest-alembic` DDL test
 
[1]

```
$ APP_DB_DSN=postgresql://$user@localhost/pytest_alembic poetry run alembic upgrade head
$ APP_DB_DSN=postgresql://$user@localhost/pytest_alembic poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate
```

If SQLAlchemy models are not as up to date as the Alembic models, the upgrade/downgrade steps will be flipped around.

## TODO

- [x]  SQLAlchemy tests
- [x]  Does the rolled back in the DB fixture mean we don't need migrations to be run, as it doesn't touch the DB?
    - no, committing the session modifies the DB
- [x]  what is 'offline mode' in Alembic?
  - where Alembic generates SQL to run externally 
- [x]  DSN is defined multiple times [1]
- [x]  GitLab CI
- [x]  More realistic tests (i.e. from locations register)
- [x]  review
